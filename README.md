# THIS IS "Notice App"

This "Notice App" was developed entirely by me.\
I spent about 150 hours developing the Notice App, and it is still under development.\
In development I used:\
• ReactJS;\
• React Hooks;\
• React-router-dom to create navigation;\
• Firebase for data storage;\
• emoji-picker-react to be able to insert emoji (beta);\
• gh-pages to deploy your application to GitHub Hosting;\
• styled-components for styling.\
At the login stage, from the available functionality there is:\
• Login page;\
• Registration Page;\
• Password change;\
• Sign in with Google.\
After you complete the Login, you will have access to such functionality as:\
• Change your avatar in the menu;\
• On the Contact page, you can create a chat with available users (in order to try the functionality, it is advisable to create a chat with a familiar user or Test Test account);\
• On the Chat page, you can start chatting with your friends. In the chat itself, you can send simple messages using Emoji(beta), attach files, videos, photos.\
• Other pages are under development!!!\
The functionality of this application will be expanded in the future.\
If you do not want to deploy applications locally, then you can follow the link - [kirill-degtyarev.github.io](https://kirill-degtyarev.github.io/#/login)\
I will be glad to accept any feedback in my Telegram [@Rat_46](https://t.me/Rat_46).
